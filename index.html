        <p>
            Games are a popular way to create an active and experiential learning among students. <br />
            <strong>A game generator </strong>
            is an online platform that allows each teacher to produce a game by himself, that relates to the exact content he teaches in class and that is exactly suited to the study group and its specific needs. The game generator allows anyone to pour their content (the questions/game stations) into the generator and get a product that is an educational game.
